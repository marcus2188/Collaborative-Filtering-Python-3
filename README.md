# Collaborative-Filtering-Python-3
A recommendation system represents a subclass of information filtering systems which seeks to predict the user preferences. Nowadays, the modern recommender systems typically generate a list of recommendations in one of the three methods through Memory-based collaborative filtering (CF), Model-based collaborative filtering (CF) and Matrix Factorization using Deep Learning(Neural Collaborative Filtering).


From e-commerce to online advertisement to video platforms, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our daily lives. Thus, recommender systems are unavoidable in our daily journeys. Recommender systems are algorithms that aim to suggest relevant items that can engage the users’ attention. Recommender systems are able to filter a user’s past behaviour by creating a relevant structure based on historical data. It then predicts the items a user might like based on the past activity and creates suggestions to the user with high probability of the user going for it. Thus, It is based on data it can acquire such as user’s information, history, like, review and much more that form the relevant structure to form a recommendation that is relatable to the user’s persona.


Here, we cover 3 different methods of collaborative Filtering. Model based, Memory based, and Deep Learning based.
